# Watermark
## This simple task can be considered as a portfolio work.
The script adds watermarks to all files in the specified folder.
I created this function for myself. Often, when looking at photos, I want to know when they were taken. Checking the EXIF-data every time is inconvenient. My program comes to the rescue and adds a watermark from EXIF-data of the file to the corner of the image without losing quality.
